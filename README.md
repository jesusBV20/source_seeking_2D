# Resilient source seeking with robot swarms - 2D

This repository was introduced in a lesson given by [Héctor García de Marina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hgdemarina/) at *MRS Summer School 2023*. It contains some Python simulations that help us to validate the results and findings presented in the following articles:

```

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, simply run:

```bash
python install.py
```

### Additional Dependencies
Some additional dependencies, such as LaTeX fonts and FFmpeg, may be required. We recommend following the installation instructions provided in the ```ssl_simulator``` [README](https://github.com/Swarm-Systems-Lab/ssl_simulator/blob/master/README.md). 

## Usage

We recommend running the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to get an overview of the project's structure and see the code in action.
